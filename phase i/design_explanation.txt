DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

Data source 1: Lichess database PGN
The data for the game, gamemoves and event tables is extracted from the database PGN

Data source 2: Lichess API
The data for the player and tournament tables is extracted from the lichess API

The link between the two data sources is shown in db_pop_pgn.py where the python script requests API data for each player and tournament encountered in the PGN file.

ISA relationship: a "game" object can be either a "regular game" or a "tournament game".
Weak entity: the gamemove entity is a weak entity since its primary key relies on a "game" entity
Referential integrity: See complex_function_trigger.sql
Hard-coded views: See full_access_views.sql and restricted_access_views.sql
Domains and types: See DDL.sql


DDL is found under DDL.sql
Queries are found under Queries.sql

our data population script is called db_pop_pgn.py and it aggregates data from both our sources into a database.
